- when adding new shadcn components, always use `pnpx shadcn@latest`, e.g. `pnpx shadcn@latest add button`
- when planning the component structure, first call `pnpx shadcn@latest list @shadcn` to check if there are suitable shadcn components. prefer those.
- when creating complex element trees, favor radix-style component structures over multiple if-else code for a cleaner solution
- after finishing your implementations, run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm tsc --noEmit`, do not build.
  - if you created tests for the current task, also run those tests via `vitest`
